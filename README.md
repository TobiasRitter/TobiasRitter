### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Tobias and I am currently working on a master's degree in Computer Science at the Technical University of Munich. My studies are currently focused on the area of Data Analytics and Machine Learning. During my bachelor's degree I had the opportunity to complete multiple internships at TRUMPF in various departments and gain practical experience in Data Analytics as well as software development.
